# Kotlin Loops
This is a demo repository that contains the content of the talk [@Android254](https://www.meetup.com/android254/) / [@KotlinKenya](https://www.meetup.com/kotlinkenya/) meetup on 13/10/2022

## Description
I will be speaking on introductory concepts of Kotlin Loops. These include:

* for-loop and its variations
* while-loop and its variations

The talk will be beginner-friendly for anyone who has never used Kotlin before.

This repository contains a single Kotlin file `Main.kt` that contains the code snippets in my slides.
